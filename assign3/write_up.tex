\begin{abstract}
Documentation is the bane of all developers yet it absolutely necessary to work with 
code bases. This assignment explores implementing an API with poor documentation. 
The focus is on device drivers and encryption/decryption.

\section{Purpose and Learning}
The purpose of this assignment was to work with a poorly documented API. 
Though the assignment decription would have you believe we were learning 
about encryption and decryption of device drivers, the real issue was learning 
how to mount and unmount a module to the kernel. We also had to learn how to test 
it. We were essentially trying to simulate a USB file system. This was difficult 
for us to wrap our heads around occassionally due to not having physical hardware 
to work with. In our pursuit of poor documentation we consulted many blogs and other
univerity resources. We also looked up the book McGrath had recommended for the device 
driver.
\section{Design Choices}
The design for this assignment was messy and essentially nonexistant. Primarily 
we needed to look up a lot of procedural how-tos: how to mount and unmount a module, 
how to create an ext2 file system, where to put our device driver, which driver to 
use, which encryption algorithm to use. Once we answered all of these questions the 
implementation was actually fairly simple: take in a key for the module parameter, 
set the key, when you read decrypt with the key, when you write encrypt with the key. 
We ended up using a sbd device driver and the ecb aes encryption. This was after mixing 
and matching between cbc and an sbull implementation so see what would compile and what 
would not. We did not have much in the way of actual design, just trial and error. If we 
were to do this again we would more formally research the two different devices and the 
various modes of the encryption to know what was absolutely necessary. Instead we consulted 
multiple, conflicting example files which caused us to toggle back and forth quite frequently. 
Ultimately this project was about how to search and read documentation and use preexisting things,
not about actively coming up with new concepts like the previous ones. 

\section{Testing}
The first part of testing was to get the kernel to boot after implementing sbull.c. Since we changed to sbd.c shortly after starting the assignment, testing was not thorough on sbull.c and was shifted to sbd.c. To test sbd.c we verified that the device was mounted, and once we could change directories to it we wrote to the device. The next part of testing was to verify encription and decription. This was a difficult trial and error period on determining when to set encription and decription, and if the key should be reset upon mounting the device or during initialization. Other testing involved verifying the right key size, encryption standard and other functionality regarding allocating and setting the key. While working on cryptography testing included implementing the device as RAM storage. RAM was verified with the mkfs.ext2 files, and when writing was verified then RAM storage was satisfactory. Cryptography was verified when encryption and decription on a string would occur on a known string back to its expected value. 

\section{Work Log}
Monday, May 15: We met as a group to begin the assignment. Before meeting the group agreed to research the assignment, and more research was needed after come collaboration on findings. After looking over email from TA we located an sbull.c file and added it to the block directory and adjusted the block Makefile. We were unable to make sufficient progress to keep working so we broke to do more research, and agreed to meet the following evening. We were capable of compiling the kernel and creating the block device. \\
Wednesday, May 17: After looking over various sbull.c and sbd.c files we changed our approach to the solution and went with sbd.c. This decision was mostly based on simplicity of the sbd.c versus sbull.c file. Then from there we were researching and trying to figure out how to implement encryption in the sbd.c file. Including linux crypto.h and understanding the sbd.c file was the first step. We continued to work off the email from the TA for help, and started to adjust sbd\_init, the key size, and also had trouble determining which encryption standard to use. We were capable of getting the kernel to compile with the addition of the sbd.c file and added print statements for testing to observe our adjustments through the evening. By the end of the evening we were capable of implementing the disk device driver and writing to it, but it was not yet RAM. \\
Sunday, May 21: Following Thursday's class and Prof McGrath's strong suggestion on encryption standard we started off with changing it to cbc(aes). Following this adjustments were continued to be made to the sbd\_init, sbd\_transfer, and key size. \\
